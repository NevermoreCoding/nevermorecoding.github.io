The first task will require teams to find a series of lights on a panel. R5 will start standing in front of a textured 
panel that contains a number of colored lights. One at a time, the lights will turn on in a random pattern. Each 
light will remain on for fixed period of time, between 5 and 20 seconds. The light pattern starts once simulation 
is run, and will continue until simulation is complete.
Successful completion of Qualification Task 1 will entail:
1. Correctly identify ten lights in a row.
2. Light identification consists of an RGB value and position in R5â€™s head frame.
a. Both the RGB and position values are allowed an error tolerance that is TBD
